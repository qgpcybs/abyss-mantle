This is the Abyss World in Mantle.

Abyss World is one of our interpretations of the standardization of the autonomous world. 

On the basis of the ECS(Entity–component–system) architecture, the entities, components and systems of the game can be decoupled. Players who never go offline become part of the autonomous world as kinds of entities. Anyone can expand the definition and use of entities through customized components and systems. 

There's no need to work out all the details of the game before it's released, nor is there any concern that additional player mechanics will cause the game's economic system to break down. We constructed a verifiable core numerical logic based on a small number of initial values (tokens) such as HP(Health Point) and AP(Attack Point). By exchanging, staking, burning, etc. between tokens, the change of values is kept within a reasonable range. And it can constantly accommodate the addition of new values.

Without considering the addition of Ai agents, the entire world runs on the actions of entities. However, it is difficult for human players to maintain a high frequency of interactions on the chain for a long time. For traditional Bot, the behavioral patterns are predictable and automated interactions are closed-loop, and do not have the ability to create a separate narrative.

The emergence of the Ai agent breaks down the limits of entity behavior and brings the last piece of the puzzle to the whole autonomous world.
